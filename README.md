# What is this?

In an effort to make curating categories of work easier, sometimes it's good to be able to watch the blockchain for stories with certain keywords in them.

This is the source code for the steem-seeress bot that runs on Discord. You don't need to do anything with this code to use the bot, please see the article detailing how to use the seeress at:

# Running your own bot

To start up this bot, you will need to:

~~~
npm i
npm run bot
~~~

The first time around, it will generate a `config.json` file and tell you to edit it's options. Do so, then run it again.
